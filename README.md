# Bánkuti Béla - szallas.hu Sitebuild task solution

This repository contains the solution for the szallas.hu Sitebuild task.

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a prototype modal based on the provided design. The modal should be reusable and displayed beneath the corresponding list item when clicked. The list items should be generated dynamically, without interrupting the sequence of items. The modal should indicate its association with the respective list item and should not obstruct other results. The layout should be responsive, with a single column on mobile devices.

## Requirements

-   Build the prototype using the Laravel Blade template engine
-   Utilize the Bootstrap 5 framework
-   Use the SCSS preprocessor
-   Implement the flexbox model for the list of results
-   Follow the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) naming convention
